<p>K6 Gallery is a proposed new exhibition space in the centre of Southampton. The space makes use of a pair of iconic grade II listed red phone boxes. Designed by architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1935. This was the sixth incarnation of the red phone box. They were a smaller and more streamlined version of the K2 model and were known as the K6 (kiosk number 6).</p>
<p>The gallery will run a diverse programme of four exhibitions a year, engaging audiences by showcasing both local and national artists with a focus on contemporary and conceptual art.</p>
<p>The gallery is run by a dedicated team of volunteers as a non-profit entity. Entrance is free.</p>
