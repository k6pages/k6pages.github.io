<h3>Crowd Funding Campaign Launched</h3>

<p>We’ve now launched our crowd funding campaign as one final push to make the gallery a reality. We’re hoping that with your support we can reach our target to refurbish the phone boxes and deliver an exciting programme of exhibitions and events.</p>

<p>We’re using the website Spacehive for the campaign which is designed with small civic projects like this in mind. You can get involved in our campaign on the Spacehive website here.  If you’d like to share the campaign on facebook or twitter or even by email then please do, that would be fantastic.</p>
